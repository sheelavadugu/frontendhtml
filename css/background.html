    	<h1>Doraemon (ドラえもん) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio. The manga was first serialized in December 1969. Its chapters were collected in 45 tankōbon volumes published by Shogakukan from 1974 to 1996. The story revolves around an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a boy named Nobita Nobi.The manga spawned a media franchise. Three anime TV series have been adapted in 1973, 1979, and 2005. Additionally, Shin-Ei Animation has produced over forty animated films, including two 3D computer-animated films, all of which are distributed by Toho. Various types of merchandise and media have been developed, including soundtrack albums, video games, and musicals. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America, via Amazon Kindle, by a collaboration of Fujiko F. Fujio Pro with Voyager Japan and AltJapan Co., Ltd. The anime series was licensed by Disney for an English-language release in North America in 2014, and LUK International in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Nobita's characterization depicts him as a lazy and flawed person, including but not limited to a lack of physical co-ordination or athletic talent, predisposition to laziness, reluctance to engage in critical thinking, and sometimes exhibits childish or even perverted behavior. He dislikes books and lacks a basic grasp of knowledge, such as being unable to understand concepts such as the definition of an eclipse. He often takes any chance to take a nap and is often known as 'The Lazy King'. In a typical episode, Nobita begs Doraemon to lend him a gadget to get revenge on his bully classmates, Gian and Suneo, show off to his classmate and future love interest, Shizuka Minamoto, or to provide convenience for himself such as getting his homework done quicker. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's gadgets, he almost always abuses the gadget's power to the point that the effect backfires on him. He envies his classmate Hidetoshi Dekisugi, a straight-A student admired by all of the girls in his class, including Shizuka. Nobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring low marks on his tests, getting scolded by his teacher and teased by Gian and Suneo, falling in the curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs, getting scolded by his mother for not completing his tasks, and being bullied by people he knows, except Shizuka.[2]Doraemon is written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio, the pen name of Japanese manga artist Hiroshi Fujimoto.[8][9][10] According to Fujio, it was originally conceived following a series of three events: when searching for ideas for a new manga, he wished a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him, he tripped over his daughter's toy, and heard cats fighting in his neighborhood.[11] To set up the plot and characters, he inspired some elements from his earlier manga series, Obake no Q-Tarō, which involve an obake living with humans, with a similar formula.[12] Fujio said that the idea for Doraemon came after "an accumulation of trial and error", during which he finally found the most suitable style of manga to him.[13] Initially, the series achieved little success as gekiga was well-known at the time, and only became a hit after its adaptation into an anime TV series and multiple feature films.[12]
